chrony.conf \- chronyd configuration file

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @SYSCONFDIR@/chrony.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIchrony\fR is a pair of programs for maintaining the accuracy of computer
clocks. \fIchronyd\fR is a background daemon program that can be started at
boot time.

Assuming that you have found some servers, you need to set up a
configuration file to run \fIchrony\fR.  The (compiled-in) default location
for this file is \fB@SYSCONFDIR@/chrony.conf\fR.  Assuming that your NTP
servers are called `foo.example.net', `bar.example.net' and `baz.example.net',
your \fBchrony.conf\fR file could contain as a minimum

.EX
     server foo.example.net
     server bar.example.net
     server baz.example.net
.EE

However, you will probably want to include some of the other directives
described in detail in the documentation supplied with the distribution
(\fIchrony.txt\fR and \fIchrony.texi\fR). The following directives may be
particularly useful : `driftfile',  `makestep', `rtcsync'.  Also, the `iburst'
server option is useful to speed up the initial synchronization.  The smallest
useful configuration file would look something like

.EX
     server foo.example.net iburst
     server bar.example.net iburst
     server baz.example.net iburst
     driftfile @CHRONYVARDIR@/drift
     makestep 10 3
     rtcsync
.EE

When using a pool of NTP servers (one name is used for multiple servers which
may change over time), it's better to specify them with the `pool' directive
instead of multiple `server' directives in order to allow \fIchronyd\fR to
replace unreachable or bad servers automatically.  The configuration file could
in this case look like

.EX
     pool pool.ntp.org iburst
     driftfile @CHRONYVARDIR@/drift
     makestep 10 3
     rtcsync
.EE
