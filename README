This is the README for chrony.

What is chrony?
===============

chrony is a versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP).
It can synchronize the system clock with NTP servers, reference clocks
(e.g. GPS receiver), and manual input using wristwatch and keyboard.
It can also operate as an NTPv4 (RFC 5905) server and peer to provide
a time service to other computers in the network.

It is designed to perform well in a wide range of conditions, including
intermittent network connections, heavily congested networks, changing
temperatures (ordinary computer clocks are sensitive to temperature),
and systems that do not run continuosly, or run on a virtual machine.

Typical accuracy between two machines on a LAN is in tens, or a few
hundreds, of microseconds; over the Internet, accuracy is typically
within a few milliseconds.  With a good hardware reference clock
sub-microsecond accuracy is possible.

Two programs are included in chrony, chronyd is a daemon that can be
started at boot time and chronyc is a command-line interface program
which can be used to monitor chronyd's performance and to change various
operating parameters whilst it is running.

What will chrony run on?
========================

The software is known to work on Linux, FreeBSD, NetBSD and Solaris.
Closely related systems may work too.  Any other system will likely
require a porting exercise.  You would need to start from one of the
existing system-specific drivers and look into the quirks of certain
system calls and the kernel on your target system.

How do I set it up?
===================

The file INSTALL gives instructions.  On supported systems the
compilation process should be automatic.

You will need an ANSI C compiler -- gcc is recommended.

The manual (in texinfo and text formats) describes how to set the
software up for the less straightforward cases.

What documentation is there?
============================

A manual is supplied in Texinfo format (chrony.texi) and
ready-formatted plain text (chrony.txt) in the distribution.

There is also information available on the chrony web pages, accessible
through the URL 

    http://chrony.tuxfamily.org/

Where are new versions announced?
=================================

There is a low volume mailing list where new versions and other
important news relating to chrony is announced.  You can join this list
by sending mail with the subject "subscribe" to

chrony-announce-request@chrony.tuxfamily.org

These messages will be copied to chrony-users (see below).

How can I get support for chrony?
and where can I discuss new features, possible bugs etc?
========================================================

There are 3 mailing lists relating to chrony.  chrony-announce was
mentioned above.  chrony-users is a users' discussion list, e.g. for
general questions and answers about using chrony.  chrony-dev is a more
technical list, e.g. for discussing how new features should be
implemented, exchange of information between developers etc.  To
subscribe to either of these lists, send a message with the subject
"subscribe" to

chrony-users-request@chrony.tuxfamily.org
or
chrony-dev-request@chrony.tuxfamily.org

as applicable.
