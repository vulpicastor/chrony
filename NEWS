consequence.

New in version 1.21
===================

* Don't include Linux kernel header files any longer : allows chrony to compile
  on recent distros.
* Stop trying to use RTC if continuous streams of error messages would occur
  (Linux with HPET).

New in version 1.20
===================

* Many small tidy-ups and security improvements
* Improve documentation (RTC support in post 2.0 kernels)
* Remove trailing \n from syslog messages
* Syslog messages now include IP and port number when packet cannot be sent.

* Add detection of Linux 2.5
* Allow arbitrary value of HZ in Linux kernel
* Fix for chrony.spec on SuSE (Paul Elliot)
* Fix handling of initstepslew if no servers are listed (John Hasler)

* Replace sprintf by snprintf to remove risk of buffer overrun (John Hasler)
* Add --help to configure script

New in version 1.19
===================

* Auto-detect kernel's timer interrupt rate (so-called 'HZ') when chronyd
  starts instead of relying on compiled-in value.
* Fix 2 bugs in function that creates the directory for the log and dump files.
* Amended webpage URL and contact details.
* Generate more informative syslog messages before exiting on failed
  assertions.
* Fix bugs in clamping code for the tick value used when slewing a large
  offset.
* Don't chown files to root during install (should be pointless, and makes RPM
  building awkward as ordinary user.)

===================
* Amend homepage and mailing list information to chrony.sunsite.dk
* Delete pidfile on exit from chronyd.

  6.7.8/20 or 6.7.8.x/20 (any x) mean a 20 bit subnet).
* The environment variables CC and CFLAGS passed to configure can now be used
  to select the compiler and optimisation/debug options to use
* Write syslog messages when chronyd loses synchronisation.

  versions.)
* Remove some compiler warnings (Solaris)
* If last line of keys file doesn't have end-of-line, don't truncate final

New in version 1.15
===================
* Add contributed change to 'configure' to support Solaris 2.8 on x86
* Workaround for assertion failure that arises if two received packets occur
  close together. (Still need to find out why this happens at all.)
* Hopefully fix problem where fast slewing was incompatible with machines
  that have a large background drift rate (=> tick value went out of range
  for adjtimex() on Linux.)
* Fix rtc_linux.c compile problems with 2.4.x kernel include files.
* Include support for RTC device not being at /dev/rtc (new rtcdevice directive
  in configuration file).

  normal assert).

New in version 1.11
===================

* Improve robustness of installation procedure
* Tidy up documenation and contact details
* Distribute manual as .txt rather than as .ps
* Add -n option to chronyc to work with numeric IP addresses rather than
  names.
* Add material in contrib subdirectory
* Improve robustness of handling drift file and RTC coefficients file
* Improve robustness of regression algorithm

New in version 1.1
==================

Bug fixes
---------

* Made linear regression more resistant to rounding errors (old one
  occasionally generated negative variances which made everything go
  haywire).  Trap infinite or 'not-a-number' values being used to
  alter system clock to increase robustness further.

Other changes/Enhancements
--------------------------

* Support for Linux 2.1 and 2.2 kernels

* New command 'makestep' in chronyc to immediately jump the system
  time to match the NTP estimated time (Linux only) - a response to
  systems booting an hour wrong after summertime/wintertime changes,
  due to RTCs running on local time.  Needs extending to Sun driver
  files too.

* New directives 'logchange' and 'mailonchange' to log to syslog or
  email to a specific address respectively if chronyd detects a clock
  offset exceeding a defined threshold.

* Added capability to log all client/peer NTP accesses and command
  accesses (can be turned off with conf file directive 'noclientlog').
  Added 'clients' command to chronyc to display this data.

* Improved manual mode to use robust regression rather than 2 point
  fit.

* Added 'manual list' and 'manual delete' commands to chronyc to
  allow display of entered timestamps and discretionary deletion of
  outliers.

* If host goes unsynchronised the dummy IP address 0.0.0.0 is detected
  to avoid attempting a reverse name lookup (to stop dial on demand IP
  links from being started)

* Changed chronyc/chronyd protocol so messages are now all variable
  length.  Saves on network bandwidth particularly for large replies
  from chronyd to chronyc (to support the clients command).

* Added bindaddress directive to configuration file, to give
  additional control over limiting which hosts can access the local
  server.

* Groundwork done for a port to Windows NT to compile with Cygwin
  toolkit.  chronyc works (to monitor another host).  sys_winnt.c
  needs finishing to use NT clock control API.  Program structure
  needs adapting to use Windows NT service functions, so it can be
  started at boot time.  Hopefully a Windows NT / Cygwin guru with
  some spare time can take this port over :-)

New in version 1.02
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* Fix error messages in chronyc if daemon is not reachable.

* Fix config file problem for 'allow all' and 'deny all' without a
  trailing machine address.

* Remove fatal failed assertion if command socket cannot be read from
  in daemon.

* Rewrote timezone handling for Linux real time clock, following
  various reported problems related to daylight saving.

Other changes/Enhancements
--------------------------

* Configure script recognizes BSD/386 and uses SunOS 4.1 driver for
  it.

* Log files now print date as day-month-year rather than as a day
  number.  Milliseconds removed from timestamps of logged data.
  Banners included in file to give meanings of columns.

* Only do 1 initial step (followed by a trimming slew) when
  initialising from RTC on Linux (previously did 2 steps).

New in version 1.01
===================

Bug fixes
---------

* Handle timezone of RTC correctly with respect to daylight saving
  time

* Syntax check the chronyc 'local' command properly

* Fixed assertion failed fault in median finder (used by RTC
  regression fitting)

Other changes/Enhancements
--------------------------

* Log selection of new NTP reference source to syslog.

* Don't zero-pad IP address fields

* Add new command to chronyc to allow logfiles to be cycled.

* Extend allow/deny directive syntax in configuration file to so
  directive can apply to all hosts on the Internet.

* Tidy up printout of timestamps to make it clear they are in UTC

* Make 'configure' check the processor type as well as the operating
  system.
