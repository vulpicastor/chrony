chrony (1.24-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed regression that caused default CHRONY_IOC_ lines to
    vanish from io_linux.h thereby breaking hppa and ia64.

    Closes: #588930: FTBFS [ia64,hppa]: "I don't know the values of the 
    _IOC_* constants on your architecture"
  
  * $remote_fs was added in 1.24-1.  Depending on networking is neither

  * Still need to rewrite scripts.
  
 -- John G. Hasler <jhasler@newsguy.com>  Fri, 30 Jul 2010 20:32:55 -0500

chrony (1.24-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  The scripts will be rewritten and many more bugs
    taken care of in -2.  Right now I want to get 1.24 out there.
  
  * Applied patch from Petter Reinholdtsen to init.d
  
    Closes: #541806: misses syslog dependency in LSB headers

 -- John G. Hasler <jhasler@newsguy.com>  Tue, 02 Feb 2010 19:37:50 -0600

chrony (1.23-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Commented out rtcfile directive in chrony.conf because it can cause
    lockups with certain combinations of motherboard and kernel (this is
    a known kernel bug).

    Closes: #508298: chronyd unreachable and does not work (clock drifts)
  
  * Chrony no longer uses the ppp/ip-up.d and ppp/ip-up.d files and the new
    init.d file won't hang if chronyc hangs.
  
    Closes: #448481: /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony doesn't work when bindaddress is set.
  
  * Cannot reproduce on current version on amd64.
  
    Closes: #412961: error in tracking report (on amd64?)
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Wed, 10 Dec 2008 14:16:37 -0600

chrony (1.23-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Replaced background kill with 'timelimit' in initscript.
  
    Closes: #505094: chrony: kills random netstat processes 

  * Added 'Recommends: udev (>= 0.124-1)'
  
    Closes: #497113: /dev/rtc renamed to /dev/rtc0 with linux-image-2.6-*/2.6.26+15
  
  * Had previously applied patch from Nathanael Nerode to fix configure
    bug but forgot to close the bug.
  
    Closes: #392273: Recursive dependency disease: chrony shouldn't depend on ncurses
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sun, 09 Nov 2008 20:19:22 -0600

chrony (1.23-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fixed dependency of init script on Pppconfig ip-up.d script by moving
    those lines into the init script.
  
  * Added checks to try to make sure that Chronyd is really, really running.
    Changed Netstat call to use -n, added code to kill it if it hangs.
    Added code to kill Chronyc if it can't contact Chronyd.
    Discussed the HPET/rtc problem in NEWS.Debian.
  
    Closes: #504000: init script hangs for a while might break upgrade

  * Added missing initialization to create_instance() in ntp_core.c.
    This was why UTI_NormaliseTimeval() was being called with huge
    values at times.

  * See comment on #195620 in 1.21z-6 below.  If you know of more LP64
    bugs reopen #348412 with a patch.
  
    Closes: #348412: chronyc not LP64 compliant
  
  * Added comment about sources being discarded to chrony.conf as suggested
    by Andreas Hübner in  #268289.
  
  * This is normal behavior.
   
    Closes: #287060: trimrtc takes 40 seconds to take effect
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Thu, 06 Nov 2008 10:38:58 -0600

chrony (1.23-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Rewrote UTI_NormaliseTimeval()in util.c to use divide/remainder
    instead of loops at the suggestion of Gabor Gombas.  This prevents the
    problem of the loop running until the sun goes out when the function
    is called with a very large value for tv_usec on 64-bit architectures.
    Also fixed some other spots where the same loop was being used.
  
    Closes: #474294 Goes into endless loop
    Closes: #447011 chronyd stalls with 100% CPU usage
     
    I still don't know why the function is being called with such a 
    large value, however.

  * Changed default servers in chrony,conf to Debian servers.
  
    Closes: #434483: chrony: Should use NTP servers in Debian pool
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat, 26 Apr 2008 11:47:44 -0500

chrony (1.23-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added default IOC's to io_linux.h.
    Closes: #477043: chrony_1.23-1(ia64/experimental): FTBFS: IOC 
    constants unknown on ia64
    Closes: #476963: chrony_1.23-1(hppa/experimental): FTBFS: "I don't 
    know the values of the _IOC_* constants for your architecture" 
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sun, 20 Apr 2008 13:29:29 -0500

chrony (1.23-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    This is 1.23 with Debian patches applied (including some for LP64).
    I'm uploading this to Experimental to get it tested on x86_64 to see
    if  #474294 is fixed.
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat, 19 Apr 2008 14:49:15 -0500

chrony (1.21z-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patches from Eric Lammerts <eric@lammerts.org> and Goswin von
    Brederlow <brederlo@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de> to cast the value
    returned by ntohl to int32_t and so cause correct sign-extension near
    line 1655 in client.c.  Also fixed similar bugs in the same area.  I'm
    not sure this entirely fixes the chronyc number display problem,
    though.  I've not closed #348412 here because chrony is still not
    fully LP64 compliant.
    Closes: #195620: Strange "System time : xxx seconds slow of
    NTP time" output

  * Replaced addrfilt.c with addrfilt.c from upstream git repository.
    This fixes the recursive structure definition problems.

  * Replaced 'route' with 'netstat -r' in the initscript.

  * Applied patch for configure script from Nathanael Nerode
    <neroden@gcc.gnu.org> to delete the superfluous "lncurses" at line
    327.
    Closes: #392273: Recursive dependency disease: chrony shouldn't depend
    on ncurses

  * Added test to reject servers claiming stratum less than 1 in
    ntp_core.c "Test 7".  Bill Unruh <unruh@physics.ubc.ca> has run across
    a server that sometimes claims to be stratum 0, which causes
    considerable confusion.

 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Fri, 16 Feb 2007 17:47:40 -0600

chrony (1.21z-5) unstable; urgency=high
  
  * Applied postinst patch from Lionel Elie Mamane to test for the
    existence of old .keys and .conf files before renaming them.  
    Closes: #397759: fails to configure: mv: cannot stat `/etc/chrony/chrony.keys.1.21-2':
    No such file or directory

  * Added burst command to /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony to give chronyd a kick in the butt.
    Shouldn't need that, though.
    Initscript now calls /etc/ppp/ip-up.d/chrony if a default route exists.
    Closes: #397739: Not connecting to sources after reboot - dialup
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sun, 26 Nov 2006 08:07:20 -0600

chrony (1.21z-4) unstable; urgency=low

    Closes: #390280: chrony: missing dependency on mail
  
  * Added LSB headers to initscript
  
  * Corrected erroneous use of 'dpkg --compare-version' in preinst and postinst.
    Closes: #386733: fails to configure (bad upgrade check)

  * Added rm to postinst to remove keyfile possibly left by a failed install.
    Closes: #390278: usage of tempfile /etc/chrony/chrony.keys is doubtful
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat,  7 Oct 2006 13:39:49 -0500

chrony (1.21z-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed upstream version number from 1.21 to 1.21z to satisfy Debian
    archive software.
  
  * Replaced impure chrony_1.21.orig.tar.gz.
    Closes: #340030: chrony: Tarball is impure
  
  * Now Provides, Conflicts, Replaces time-daemon
    Closes: #330839: time-daemon pseudopackage

    Closes: #321121: chrony: typo in 'Conflicts:' field: s/ntpsimple/ntp-simple/ and s/ntprefclock/ntp-refclock/

  * Corrected references in man pages.
    Closes: #345034: chrony: man pages refer to wrong sections
  
  * Added "allow 172.16/12" to chrony.conf.
    Closes: #252952: chrony: default allow should also have 172.16/12
  
  * Channged server lines in chrony.conf to follow ntp.org current recommendation.
    Closes: #243534: chrony: new pool.ntp.org setup doesn't work well
  
  * Fixed FSF address in debian/copyright.

chrony (1.21-2) unstable; urgency=high
  
  * Patched io_linux.h to add missing architectures.

    _IOC_* constants for your architecture"
  
  * Fixed brown-bag error in rules.

chrony (1.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
    Closes: #328292: New version of chrony avalaible
    Closes: #301592: Fails to read RTC and floods logfiles
  
  * Enabled RTC as upstream has installed a work-around for the HPET bug.

  * Switched to libreadline5.
    Closes: #326379: please rebuild with libreadline5-dev as build dependency
  
  * Patched addrfilt.c to fix gcc 4.0 build problem.
    Closes: #298709: chrony: FTBFS (amd64/gcc-4.0): array type has incomplete element type
  
  * There are lots more minor things to fix but I'm uploading now to close

    in a few weeks.

chrony (1.20-8) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added test for /usr/bin/mail in postinst.
    Closes: #307061: Install failure: Cannot configure on system without mailx
    I consider this bug serious because it can cause installation to fail
    and so I want to get the fix into Sarge.
  
  * Fixed typo in chrony.conf, replaced '/etc/init.d/chrony restart'
    with 'invoke-rc.d chrony restart'.
    Closes: #305090: Typo in chrony.conf, should mention invoke-rc.d

  * Added README.Debian explaining that rtc is off by default.
  
 -- John Hasler <jhasler@debian.org>  Sat, 30 Apr 2005 18:47:30 -0500

chrony (1.20-7) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added info-4 to debian/rules.
    Closes: #287142: chrony: Can't find chrony.info-4

  * Corrected "See Also" section in chrony man page.  Now mentions
    chronyc(1), chronyd(8), and chrony.conf(5).
    Closes: #287444: chrony.1.gz: SEE ALSO on man page has wrong section.
  
  * Edited chrony.conf to disable rtc by default and explain why:
    on some systems that use genrtc or the HPET real-time clock it
    fails and causes chronyd to fill up the log.  The failure is
    probably due to a kernel bug, bug the logging should be
    throttled.
  
  * Added more explanatory comments at the servers directive in 
    chrony.conf.
  
  * The postinst script now sends a message to root saying where the
    password is, whether Chrony is assuming UTC or local time,
    that rtc updating is disabled, why, and how to change it.
  
  * Added missing '#' to
    "Can't tell how your clock is set: assuming local time."
    in postinst.
